I'm Rada.
Work with me to give your ideas a beautiful web presence.

A chemical engineer turned web developer, I've always been passionate about problem-solving. Nothing like watching the journey from a newborn idea to the final product. I love it all, the brainstorming, the research, the development, even the frustration that comes before breakthroughs.
One of my strengths is I work well regardless of the setup: independently, on a team, or under immediate supervision. This means you can give me as much or as little direction as you'd like, whether you have a clear vision or merely a general concept of the final product.
